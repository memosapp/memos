# Profile Editing Feature

This document describes the new profile editing functionality that allows users to update their display name and avatar from the settings page.

## Features

### âœ¨ What's New

- **Display Name Editing**: Users can update their display name with real-time validation
- **Avatar Upload**: Users can upload and change their profile picture
- **Live Preview**: See changes before saving
- **Form Validation**: Comprehensive validation with user-friendly error messages
- **Storage Management**: Automatic cleanup of old avatars
- **Responsive Design**: Works seamlessly on all devices

### ðŸ”§ Technical Implementation

#### Frontend Components

- **Enhanced Settings Page**: `/apps/frontend/app/settings/page.tsx`
  - Toggle between view and edit modes
  - Real-time form validation
  - File upload handling
  - Avatar preview functionality
  - Character counter for display name

#### Backend Storage

- **Supabase Storage Integration**: Secure file upload and management
- **User-Isolated Storage**: Each user has their own avatar folder
- **Automatic Cleanup**: Old avatars are removed when new ones are uploaded
- **Public CDN**: Avatars are served via Supabase's CDN for performance

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Configure Supabase Storage

#### Option A: Automated Setup

```bash
cd apps/backend
./setup_avatar_storage.sh
```

#### Option B: Manual Setup

1. Run the SQL commands in `apps/backend/setup_avatar_storage.sql`
2. Create the "avatars" bucket in Supabase dashboard
3. Set up the storage policies

### 2. Verify Setup

1. Check that the "avatars" bucket exists in your Supabase storage
2. Ensure storage policies are active
3. Test avatar upload functionality

## Usage

### For Users

1. Navigate to Settings page
2. Click "Edit Profile" button
3. Update display name and/or upload new avatar
4. Preview changes before saving
5. Click "Save Changes" to apply

- User metadata is updated securely through Supabase Auth

## File Structure

```
apps/
â”œâ”€â”€ frontend/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ app/
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ settings/
â”‚           â””â”€â”€ page.tsx              # Enhanced settings page
â”œâ”€â”€ backend/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ setup_avatar_storage.sql     # SQL setup script
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ setup_avatar_storage.sh      # Automated setup script
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ AVATAR_STORAGE_SETUP.md      # Storage setup documentation
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ ...
â””â”€â”€ ...
```

## Storage Structure

Avatars are organized in Supabase storage as follows:

```
avatars/
â”œâ”€â”€ user-id-1/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ 1642123456789.jpg
â”œâ”€â”€ user-id-2/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ 1642123456790.png
â””â”€â”€ ...
```

## Error Handling

### User-Friendly Messages

- Clear validation errors for display name
- Informative upload error messages
- Success confirmation on save

### Technical Error Handling

- Network failure recovery
- File upload retry logic
- Graceful degradation for storage issues

## Performance Considerations

### Frontend Optimizations

- File preview without upload
- Debounced validation
- Efficient state management
- Minimal re-renders

### Backend Optimizations

- CDN delivery for avatars
- Automatic old file cleanup
- Efficient storage organization
- Proper cache headers

## Testing

### Manual Testing Checklist

- [ ] Display name validation (empty, too short, too long)
- [ ] Avatar upload (various formats, size limits)
- [ ] Edit mode toggle functionality
- [ ] Cancel changes functionality
- [ ] Save changes with success feedback
- [ ] Error handling for network issues
- [ ] Responsive design on different screen sizes

### Automated Testing

Consider adding tests for:

- Form validation logic
- File upload functionality
- Storage policy enforcement
- Error boundary behavior

## Common Issues & Solutions

### 1. Storage Bucket Not Found

**Problem**: Avatar upload fails with "bucket not found" error
**Solution**: Run the setup script or create the bucket manually

### 2. Permission Denied

**Problem**: Users can't upload avatars
**Solution**: Check that storage policies are correctly set up

### 3. Large File Upload Fails

**Problem**: Files over 2MB fail to upload
**Solution**: This is intentional - inform users about the size limit

### 4. Old Avatar Not Removed

**Problem**: Previous avatar remains in storage
**Solution**: Check that the cleanup logic is working properly

## Future Enhancements

### Short Term

- [ ] Crop/resize functionality for uploaded images
- [ ] Progress indicator for file uploads
- [ ] Drag and drop avatar upload
- [ ] Remove avatar option

### Long Term

- [ ] Image compression before upload
- [ ] Thumbnail generation
- [ ] Avatar history/versioning
- [ ] Bulk profile management (admin)
- [ ] Social media profile import

## API Changes

### Authentication Updates

The profile editing uses existing Supabase Auth APIs:

- `supabase.auth.updateUser()` for display name updates
- `supabase.storage.from('avatars').upload()` for avatar uploads

### State Management

Profile data is managed in the Redux store:

- `profileSlice.ts` updated to handle user metadata
- Local state for edit mode and form validation

## Migration Notes

### Existing Users

- No database migration required
- Existing user metadata remains unchanged
- New fields are optional and backward compatible

### Deployment

1. Deploy backend changes first
2. Set up storage bucket and policies
3. Deploy frontend changes
4. Test functionality end-to-end

## Monitoring

### Key Metrics

- Avatar upload success rate
- Storage usage growth
- Profile update frequency
- Error rates by type

### Storage Monitoring

- Monitor storage quota usage
- Track file upload patterns
- Check for orphaned files
