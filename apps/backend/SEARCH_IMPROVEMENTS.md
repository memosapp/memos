# Search Improvements Documentation

## Overview

The search functionality has been significantly improved to reduce irrelevant results and provide more accurate semantic matching. This document explains the improvements and how to tune them.

## Key Improvements

### 1. Stricter Keyword Matching (40% weight)

- **Exact word matches**: Get full 0.4 weight using word boundary regex (`\y`)
- **Partial matches**: Get reduced 0.2 weight using ILIKE pattern matching
- **Benefit**: Prevents substring matches in unrelated contexts

### 2. Improved Vector Similarity (30% weight)

- **Threshold filtering**: Only considers vectors with similarity > 0.7
- **Benefit**: Eliminates low-quality semantic matches that were causing irrelevant results

### 3. Reduced Importance Boost (10% weight)

- **Previously**: 20% weight could dominate relevance scoring
- **Now**: 10% weight provides subtle boost without overwhelming other factors

### 4. Minimum Relevance Threshold

- **Threshold**: 0.15 minimum relevance score required
- **Implementation**: Subquery wrapper filters out low-scoring results
- **Benefit**: Eliminates results that only score on importance/popularity

### 5. Adjusted Popularity Boost (5% weight)

- **Reduced impact**: From 10% to 5% weight
- **Benefit**: Prevents frequently accessed but irrelevant memos from ranking high

## Scoring Breakdown

```
Total Score = Keyword Matching + Vector Similarity + Importance + Popularity
            = (0.4 or 0.2) + (0.3 if >0.7) + (0.1 * importance) + (0.05 * access_count/100)
```

### Example Scenarios

1. **Exact keyword match with high similarity**: 0.4 + 0.3 + 0.1 + 0.05 = 0.85 (excellent)
2. **Partial keyword match with medium similarity**: 0.2 + 0.0 + 0.1 + 0.05 = 0.35 (good)
3. **High importance but no keyword/semantic match**: 0.0 + 0.0 + 0.1 + 0.05 = 0.15 (filtered out)
4. **Low similarity semantic match**: 0.0 + 0.0 + 0.1 + 0.05 = 0.15 (filtered out)

## Tuning Options

### Minimum Relevance Threshold

```sql
WHERE relevance_score >= 0.15  -- Adjust this value
```

- **Lower (0.1)**: More permissive, returns more results
- **Higher (0.25)**: More strict, fewer but higher quality results

### Vector Similarity Threshold

```sql
WHEN (1 - (embedding <=> $2::vector)) > 0.7  -- Adjust this value
```

- **Lower (0.6)**: More semantic matches included
- **Higher (0.8)**: Only very similar content included

### Weight Distribution

Current weights can be adjusted:

- **Keyword matching**: 40% (0.4 exact, 0.2 partial)
- **Vector similarity**: 30% (0.3 when > threshold)
- **Importance boost**: 10% (0.1 \* importance)
- **Popularity boost**: 5% (0.05 \* access_count/100)

## Testing

Use the test script to verify improvements:

```bash
cd apps/backend
node test-search.js
```

### Expected Results

- **Relevant queries**: Should return meaningful results with good scores
- **Irrelevant queries**: Should return no results or very few low-scoring results
- **Gibberish queries**: Should return no results due to relevance threshold

## Performance Considerations

### Positive Impacts

- **Reduced result set**: Fewer irrelevant results to process
- **Better caching**: More meaningful cache hits
- **Improved user experience**: More relevant results

### Potential Impacts

- **Regex matching**: Word boundary matching may be slightly slower than ILIKE
- **Subquery filtering**: Additional WHERE clause adds minimal overhead
- **Vector calculations**: Threshold check happens during scoring (no extra cost)

## Monitoring

The search controller now logs:

- Number of results found
- Relevance score distribution (min, max, average)
- Query performance metrics

Example log output:

```
Search completed: found 5 results for query "javascript"
Relevance scores: min=0.18, max=0.85, avg=0.423
```

## Common Issues and Solutions

### No Results for Valid Queries

- **Check**: Minimum relevance threshold might be too high
- **Solution**: Reduce threshold from 0.15 to 0.10

### Still Getting Irrelevant Results

- **Check**: Vector similarity threshold might be too low
- **Solution**: Increase threshold from 0.7 to 0.8

### Missing Expected Results

- **Check**: Word boundary matching might be too strict
- **Solution**: Increase weight of partial matching or add additional matching patterns

## Future Improvements

1. **Dynamic thresholds**: Adjust thresholds based on query complexity
2. **Query expansion**: Add synonyms and related terms
3. **User feedback**: Learn from user interactions to improve relevance
4. **Faceted search**: Add filters for date ranges, content types, etc.
5. **Personalization**: Adjust weights based on user behavior patterns
